  "description": "As part of the testing and validation of our S-index, we collected the metadata from 49M+ datasets, computed their FAIR scores, collected their citations, identified their mentions, assigned them a research field, calculated their Dataset Index, and computed the S-index of their authors. This repository contains the Jupyter notebook we developed to analyze and visualize all that data. ",
